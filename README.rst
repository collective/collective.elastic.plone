========================
collective.elastic.plone
========================

OpenSearch or ElasticSearch Integration for Plone content.

It consists of these parts:

- indexer passing content to a separate running `collective.elastic.ingest <https://github.com/collective/collective.elastic.ingest>`_ service.
- catalog index acting as a proxy to Open-/ElasticSearch, integrates with ZCatalog. I.e. use as drop-in replacement for ``SearchableText`` index.
- custom plugins for ``plone.restapi`` to provide structural information for the ingestion service
- REST API endpoint ``@kitsearch`` accepting Open-/ ElasticSearch query returning results with Plone permission check.

Installation
============

-------------
Preconditions
-------------

You need a working ``collective.elastic.ingest`` service running.
This implies a running Redis instance and a running Open- xor ElasticSearch instance.

------------
mxdev/mxmake
------------

Add ``collective.elastic.plone[redis,opensearch]`` to your ``requirements.txt``.
The extra requirements are needed for the queue server and index server used and may vary, see below.
Alternatively add it to your ``pyproject.toml`` as dependencies (or in case of legacy code to ``setup.[py|cfg]``).

Provide and *source* an environments variable file (i.e. `.env`) in your backend directory before Plone startup with::

    export INDEX_SERVER=localhost:9200
    export INDEX_USE_SSL=1
    export INDEX_OPENSEARCH=1
    export INDEX_LOGIN=admin
    export INDEX_PASSWORD=admin
    export INDEX_NAME=plone
    export CELERY_BROKER=redis://localhost:6379/0


--------
Buildout
--------

Install `collective.elastic.plone` by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    # ...

    eggs =
        # ...
        collective.elastic.plone

    environment-vars +=
        INDEX_SERVER=localhost:9200
        INDEX_USE_SSL=1
        INDEX_OPENSEARCH=1
        INDEX_LOGIN=admin
        INDEX_PASSWORD=admin
        INDEX_NAME=plone
        CELERY_BROKER=redis://localhost:6379/0


and run ``bin/buildout``

------------------
Extra requirements
------------------

Depending on the queue server and index server used, the extra requirements vary:

- queue server: ``redis`` or ``rabbitmq``.
- index server: ``opensearch`` or ``elasticsearch``.


-------------
After Startup
-------------

After startup you need to install the addon in Plone via the Addons control panel.
This replaces the SearchableText index with the proxy index and a minimal configuration.
Best is to alter the configuration to the projects needs.
To index all content a manual re-index of the catalog is needed.

--------------
Volto Frontend
--------------

The proxy index works out of the box in Volto.

However, in Volto a direct (and much faster) search is possible by using the ``@kitsearch`` endpoint, bypassing the catalog.
The endpoint takes a native Open-/ ElasticSearch query and returns the results with Plone permission check.

The Volto add-on `volto-searchkit-block <https://github.com/rohberg/volto-searchkit-block/>`_ provides a configurable block using this endpoint.


Configuration
=============

Global configuration is done via environment variables.

Each catalog proxy-index has its distinct JSON configuration.

-----------
Environment
-----------

Environment variables are:

INDEX_SERVER
    The URL of the ElasticSearch or OpenSearch server.

    Default: localhost:9200

INDEX_NAME
    The name of the index to use at the ElasticSearch or OpenSearch service.

    Default: plone

INDEX_USE_SSL
    Whether to use a secure connection or not.

    Default: 0

INDEX_OPENSEARCH
    Whether to use OpenSearch or ElasticSearch.

    Default: 1

INDEX_LOGIN
    Username for the ElasticSearch 8+ or OpenSearch 2 server.
    For the Plone addon read access is enough.

    Default: admin

INDEX_PASSWORD
    Password of the above user

    Default: admin

CELERY_BROKER
    The broker URL for Celery.
    See `docs.celeryq.dev <https://docs.celeryq.dev/>`_ for details.

    Default: `redis://localhost:6379/0`

-----------
Proxy-index
-----------

Trough-the-web the proxy-index can be configured in the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) under ``portal_catalog``, then click on the ``ElasticSearchProxyIndex`` (i.e. ``SearchableText``).

In the file system it can be configured as any other index in the ``portal_catalog`` tool using a GenericSetup profile and placing a ``catalog.xml`` file in there.
The index configuration looks like so:

```xml
  <index meta_type="ElasticSearchProxyIndex"
         name="SearchableText"
  >
    <querytemplate>
{
    "query":{
        "bool":{
            "should":[
                    {
                        "query_string":{
                            "query":"{{keys[0].decode('utf8')}}",
                            "fields":[
                                "title^1.2",
                                "id",
                                "description^1.1",
                                "subjects^2"
                                ]
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "nested":{
                            "path":"text__extracted",
                            "query":{
                                "query_string":{
                                    "query":"{{keys[0].decode('utf8')}}",
                                    "fields":["text__extracted.content"]
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "nested":{
                            "path":"file__extracted",
                            "query":{
                                "query_string":{
                                    "query":"{{keys[0].decode('utf8')}}",
                                    "fields":["file__extracted.content"]
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "nested":{
                            "path":"image__extracted",
                            "query":{
                                "query_string":{
                                    "query":"{{keys[0].decode('utf8')}}",
                                    "fields":["image__extracted.content"]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
    </querytemplate>
```

It uses Jinja2 templating to inject the search term into the query.
The variable ``keys`` is a list of search terms, usually just one.
The resulting query is a standard ElasticSearch query.
